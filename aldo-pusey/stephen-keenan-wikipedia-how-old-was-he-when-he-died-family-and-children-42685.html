He had been a passionate free diver since 2009 and was a certified instructor-trainer who has guided hundreds of dives worldwide. One of the best freediving schools in the world, Dahab Freedivers, is owned in part by the diver. Over his illustrious diving career, he achieved several Irish national records in free diving.</strong></p><h2>Stephen Keenan Wikipedia: How Old Was He When He Died?</h2><p>The tragic tale of diver Stephen is receiving more attention following the release of Laura McGann’s Netflix documentary “The Deepest Breath.” As more people become aware of Stephen Keenan and the circumstances surrounding his death, more people are searching for “Stephen Keenan Wikipedia.” The scuba diver was born in Glasnevin, Ireland, on December 1, 1977. His early years were centered around his love of the Gaelic sport of hurling, which he played avidly while attending school.</p><p>His life changed after studying microbiology when he developed an interest in freediving while traveling to Egypt. He decided to study under Caleb Hollister, the SCUBA Dive Master, at the Seventh Heaven Hotel in 2008. Throughout his dive training, the firefighter developed into a skilled diving instructor who spent several years imparting his underwater knowledge.</p><p>Coached divers from all over the world, he co-founded the renowned freediving school Dahab Freedivers in 2009. During his remarkable career, the diver set several national records for freediving in Ireland. He currently holds the three depth records (81 m CWT, 74 m FIM, and 52 m CNF) as of the 2017 report, which is evidence of his extraordinary skill.</p><p>Sadly, the swimmer passed away in July 2017 while trying to save his fiancée and diving companion, Alessia Zecchini, during a leisure dive in Egypt. His apparatus malfunctioned, resulting in a drowning death. The snorkeler’s pals praised him for his altruistic sacrifice of himself to save a fellow diver in need, calling him a hero and angelic protector.</p><p>Keenan was a renowned figure in the freediving scene because of his extraordinary abilities and selflessness, even at such a young age. His sudden passing cemented his status as one of Ireland’s best divers.</p><h2>Stephen Keenan Children</h2><p>It appears from the information that is available that Stephen was childless at the time of his untimely death in 2017. Nothing in the public domain suggests that he was a parent or had children.</p><p>It would seem logical to conclude that the diver did not have any sons or girls given the lack of evidence pointing to his fatherhood. Keenan may have chosen not to have children to focus on his love of extreme sports. He also worked as a professional freediver and instructor around the world for most of his adult life.</p><p><strong>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Kaylin Wiley</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Averie Gilley</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Sophierosejm</a>.</strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Firefighter</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Who Is Sammie Okposo Wife Ozioma Sammie Okposo?
