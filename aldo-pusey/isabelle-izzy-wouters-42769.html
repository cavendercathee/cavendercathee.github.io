Izzy’s exact date of birth was unknown. Many sources on the internet estimated her age to be in her late twenties. According to most sources, she cannot be older than 29 as of December 2020.</p><p>Because her exact birthday was unknown, her zodiac sign was also unknown.</p><h2><span id=Isabelle_Izzy_Wouters8217_nationality_family_and_early_life>Isabelle “Izzy” Wouters’ nationality, family, and early life</span></h2><p>Isabelle “Izzy” Wouters was born in New Zealand but moved to Australia when she was four years old. As a result, she grew up and spent the majority of her childhood in Australia, and she considers Australia to be her nationality.</p><p>Aside from that, little was known about her childhood and almost nothing about her family. Izzy had mentioned her father a few times on Instagram but had never revealed his name.</p><h2><span id=Height_Weight_and_Distinctive_Characteristics>Height, Weight, and Distinctive Characteristics</span></h2><p><strong>Isabelle “Izzy” Wouters is a tall woman, standing 5 feet 8 inches tall.</strong> In addition, <strong>she has an impressive weight of 56 kg,</strong> which is a very balanced weight for a woman her height.</p><p>Her distinguishing features include her bright blue eyes, dark brown hair, and, of course, that adorable toothy smile.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Instagram_Facebook_and_Twitter><span class="TextRun BCX8 SCXW240464475" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=auto><span class="NormalTextRun BCX8 SCXW240464475" data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2">Social Media: Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter</span></span></span></h2><p>Isabelle “Izzy” Wouters was not well-known on social media at the time. In comparison to other reality TV stars, she had a very small following on both Instagram and Twitter.</p><p>By April 2021, she had 120 tweets and 11.4k followers on Twitter. Similarly, she had only 3.54k followers on Twitter. That number could skyrocket as more episodes of her show air.</p><p>Only one episode of the new season of Below Deck had been released (4 November 2020). Given the popularity of Below Deck, Izzy’s social media following was bound to grow.</p><h2><span id=Isabelle_Izzy_Wouters_Professional_Life_Career><span class="TextRun SCXW220984383 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=auto><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW220984383 BCX8">Isabelle “Izzy” Wouters: Professional Life, Career</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW220984383 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>She joined the cast of Below Deck for the eighth season, talking about the show and Izzy’s adventures at sea. The show’s eighth season was announced in September 2020, and it will premiere on November 2, 2020.</p><p>The crew of the show spent the eighth season aboard the yacht My Seanna. How did Izzy end up on My Seanna’s crew? According to Bravo TV’s official website, it happened by chance.</p><p>Izzy was planning a trip to Europe about four years ago when she encountered the sea-journey for the first time. And once she got the taste in her mouth, Izzy couldn’t stop thinking about it. Her name was given to her by the sea.</p><p>She then got her first job as a stewardess and went on to become a certified yacht master. Then she landed a big role as a stewardess in My Seanna and appeared on Bravo TV’s Below Deck. She aspired to be a deckhand on a yacht one day. Francesca Rubi, the chief stewardess on My Seanna, was another Aussie.</p><p>According to numerous online sources, the stewardesses on Below Deck earn around $50,000 per season. Included in that figure are their charter company salary, tips from guests, and a small appearance fee paid by Below Deck‘s production team.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_worth_of_Isabelle_Izzy_Wouters><span class="TextRun SCXW123332147 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=none><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW123332147 BCX8">What is the Net worth of Isabelle “Izzy” Wouters?</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW123332147 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>Izzy’s net worth was estimated to be around $200 thousand as of April 2021.</p><p><b><span data-contrast=auto>Isabelle “Izzy” Wouters&nbsp;estimated Net Worth</span></b><span data-contrast=auto>, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.

According to her Instagram, many people assumed she was looking for a boyfriend and possibly a husband. Their assumptions would be incorrect (more on that later).</p><p>Izzy was also a jovial person who was not afraid to make fun of her own singledom. She recently joked on Twitter about making beds as sex practice. In the video, she says, “I haven’t banged anyone in a while, so I guess it’s good to get some practice in.”</p><p>That sparked a fun Twitter exchange with My Seanna co-star and chef Rachel Hargrove. They seemed to enjoy each other’s company. For the time being, Izzy must make do with a friend in Rachel, and perhaps she can find someone in My Seanna.</p><p>Isabella “Izzy” Wouters came out as a lesbian in mid-December 2020. “The face of the straight men who slide into my dm’s when I say – HELLO MY NAME IS IZZY AND I AM OUT AND PROUD,” she wrote on Instagram.</p><p>Isabella went on to say on Instagram, “Hello world, I’m Izzy, and I’m a very lanky lesbian.”Isabella, on the other hand, did not say whether she had a girlfriend or was looking for one. Isabelle “Izzy” Wouters is a lesbian and a girlfriend.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Who Is Lara Fraser?
