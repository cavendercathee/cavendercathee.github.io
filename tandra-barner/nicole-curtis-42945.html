She stated that she was not in a relationship with Nicole. Nicole, according to her side of the story, had completely “disenfranchised” herself from her family, which included her mother, Joan Curtis, father, Rod Curtis, and brother, Ryan Curtis.</p><p>According to the celebrity insider, Nicole and her mother had not seen each other since the court hearing when Joan requested a protective order against Nicole. The court, however, denied the request and instead advised Nicole and her mother to avoid each other.</p><p>Having said that, Nicole’s relationship with her parents has deteriorated since 2015, when her son, Ethan, moved in with her.</p><h2><span id=Nicole_Curtis_Stats>Nicole Curtis Stats</span></h2><p><strong>Nicole Curtis, who appears much younger, stands 5′ 3′′ tall in her well-kept physique.</strong></p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Instagram_Facebook_and_Twitter><span class="TextRun SCXW188248731 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=auto><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW188248731 BCX8" data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2">Social Media: Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter</span></span></span></h2><p>Nicole Curtis had 290k Instagram followers, 1.1 million Facebook followers, and 122.5k Twitter followers as of January 2021.</p><h2><span id=Nicole_Curtis_HGTV_and_Career>Nicole Curtis HGTV, and Career</span></h2><p>The author of Better Than New began his journey in the late 1990s, restoring older properties that were about to be demolished. She began with personal properties in Minneapolis, Tampa, Atlanta, and Los Angeles before being offered the opportunity to lead her advocacy for advocates for the ‘preservation and restoration of existing architecture’ on DIY (followed by HGTV).</p><p>In March of 2010, she decided to leave her job as a realtor at RE/MAX Results to pursue a career in television. And, after a few years of enjoying her time on HGTV, she joined the Keller Williams Integrity team.</p><p>Nicole Curtis has a son, a daughter, and a baby father.</p><p>Nicole became pregnant with Ethan, her “Christmas Eve baby,” shortly after graduating from the University of Michigan. According to reports, she was only 20 years old at the time. (For the record, Nicole originally planned to study law in college but later changed her major to education.)</p><p>In terms of Ethan’s father, Nicole famously raised her first child as a single mother.</p><p>In July of 2015, she announced that she was expecting her second child, Harper, a son. She didn’t have a child.</p><p>She was also living in a renovated 1904 home in Detroit at the time. No one knew if she received any assistance in raising Harper from Shane Maguire, Harper’s father, and Nicole’s ex. All we know is that they reached a custody agreement in 2018 after a years-long legal battle. According to reports, the estranged lovers agreed to share joint custody.</p><p>The agreement they signed stated that neither of them could put Harper on medication for more than 30 days without the other’s permission, and neither of them could relocate without penalty. And, unlike in other cases (Nicole and Shane were not married), no one is required to pay child support. Instead, Nicole was said to be putting $250K into a trust for her child.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_worth_of_Nicole_Curtis><span class="TextRun SCXW223696700 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=none><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW223696700 BCX8">What is the Net worth of Nicole Curtis?</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW223696700 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>Nicole, a well-known licensed realtor, interior designer, and reality TV show personality, was reported to have a $7 million net worth in 2021.</p><p><b><span data-contrast=auto>Nicole Curtis&nbsp;estimated Net Worth</span></b><span data-contrast=auto>, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.

That is one of the reasons why her relationship status was unknown at the time.</p><p>Even though she announced her new boyfriend to the world in mid-2019, she did not provide much follow-up.
