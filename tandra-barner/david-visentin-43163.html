Scroll below and check more detailed information about Current Net worth as well as Monthly/Year Salary, Expenses, Income Reports!</span></h3><h2><span id=Is_that_David_Visentin_Gay>Is that David Visentin Gay?</span></h2><p>That was one question that troubled the minds of David’s many fans, even though David never really wanted to share that aspect of his personal life.If we had to answer the question in one dismissive phrase, the answer would have been no. David was not gay as far as the facts were concerned. David was married to a woman named Krista Grycko-Visentin, who was a real estate agent like David. She worked with David in their firm, Country Living Realty Ltd.David and Krista were married in 2006 and together they had a son named Logan in 2011. David, his wife, Krista, and their son, Logan, were living in Ontario, Canada.</p><p>That was just as big a piece of evidence as it might have been against the speculation that David was gay. Beyond that, if anything remains, it is in the deepest corners of David’s heart. One fascinating wiki: almost the entire Visentin family worked in real estate. Apart from his wife, David’s father, two brothers and a sister were real estate agents.</p><h2><span id=His_8220Relationship8221_to_Hilary_Farr>His “Relationship” to Hilary Farr</span></h2><p>Another common speculation among David’s fans and broader Love It or List It fans was the essence of the relationship between David and his co-host Hilary Farr. In Love It or List It, David and Hilary collaborated as a team, where David was the real estate agent, and Hilary was the interior designer of the houses they sold. Inside the premises of the show, David and Hilary fought competitively much like an old married couple.</p><p>David Visentin and Hilary Farr in Love It or List It Around 2020 (PC: Love It or List It IG)That, of course, prompted people to speculate that David and Hilary may have a real-life relationship, too. Again, this was unfounded speculation. David is married elsewhere, as we have already said. Whereas, Hilary was married once, and also had a son from that marriage. However, in recent years, she has had a very rough divorce. After her divorce, Hilary kept her date of life strictly secret.</p><p>This is not to suggest that there is no platonic relationship between Hilary and David. In one interview, Hilary described David as a “breaking brother.” They were also highly competitive, too. Since the style of the show Love It or List It was based on the rivalry between the two of them, they often got angry with each other and try to get one with the other. That, of course, did not take away the amicability between them.</p><h2><span id=How_high_is_David_Visentin>How high is David Visentin?</span></h2><p>Now, let’s just tell you some fascinating truthful wikis about David. First of all, the physical features. David Visentin was <strong>five foot 11 inches tall.</strong> He had a receding hairline and almost no hair on the front of his head. In addition, David had a charming smile on his broad cheeks.</p><h2><span id=David_Visentin_Net_Worth_Salary_Details>David Visentin Net Worth, Salary Details</span></h2><p>Talking about David Visentin’s net worth and salary details, he’s estimated to get about $300 thousand a Love It or List It season. A 2019 report by cheatsheet.com, however, reported that David had pocketed <strong>$50 thousand</strong> per year of the show. In addition, David also had a stream of income from his own real estate business.In sum, the net value of David Visentin was valued at about $4.2 million. His wife, meanwhile,<strong> had a fortune of $8 million.</strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>celebrities</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Sophia Ann Bates</a></h3>Sophia Ann Bates estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
