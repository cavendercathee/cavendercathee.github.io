She was conceived through IVF.</span></h2><p>Navy Rome Williams is a celebrity daughter, as previously said.

Similarly, she will be four years old on February 4, 2023.</p><p>Williams weighed roughly 7 lbs and 12 oz at the time of her birth, and to express his joy at having a child, the country singer took to Instagram and uploaded a photo of her with the message,</p><p>“She was born on 2/4/19, weighing 7lbs 12oz and looking exactly like her older brother. “I can’t wait to see what life has in store for this little princess.”</p><p>Similarly, her mother communicated her joy by stating,</p><p>“At 12:45 p.m. today, we welcomed our daughter Navy Rome into the world.” 7lbs 12oz of absolute opulence “We adore you, baby girl!!”</p><p>Navy Rome is of Caucasian heritage, and she is the granddaughter of Barry Aldean and Debbie Aldean on her father’s side, and Donald Kerr and Debbie Kerr on her mother’s side.</p><h2><span id=Why_did_Jason_Aldean_give_his_daughter_the_name_Navy>Why did Jason Aldean give his daughter the name Navy?</span></h2><p>Jason, the Don’t You Wanna Stay singer, spoke about how he and his partner came up with the name for their 3-year-old daughter during an interview with SiriusXM. He stated,</p><p>“Roman was one of the names Brittany wanted for Memphis [Navy’s brother], and I didn’t like it.” So she had the name Navy for this round, which I thought was cool. Growing up, my name was extremely common. There were usually five Jasons in my class, which I found so aggravating… so I just wanted them to have names that weren’t too strange but were distinct enough.”</p><h2><span id=Williams_Has_Three_Siblings_Is_she_Memphis_Aldean8217s_twin>Williams Has Three Siblings: Is she Memphis Aldean’s twin?</span></h2><p>The celebrity child has three siblings. Memphis Aldean Williams, her brother, was born on December 1, 2017. He is the eldest son of Jason Aldean and Brittany Kerr Aldean, and he is five years old.</p><p>Many people have asked if Navy and Memphis are twins; they are not; however, their mother, Jessica, has stated that they could have been twins. Jason and Brittany considered having their children at the same time because they were both born through IVF.</p><p>“FUN FACT: Both of our babies are IVF babies,” Kerr wrote on Instagram. “We almost put Memphis and Navy in at the same time because multiples seemed AMAZING to me after our long infertility journey,” she stated. “I talked myself out of it, and Memphis was transferred first.”</p><p>Navy Williams also has two half-siblings from her father’s first marriage to Jessica Aldean aka Jessica Ann Ussery. On February 14, 2003, the couple welcomed their daughter Keeley Ann Williams into the world. Similarly, on August 20, 2007, they had their second daughter, Kendyl Aldean Williams.</p><h2><span id=The_father_and_mother_of_Navy_Rome_survived_the_2017_Las_Vegas_shooting>The father and mother of Navy Rome survived the 2017 Las Vegas shooting.</span></h2><p>The country artist was singing at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival on October 1, 2017, and Navy’s mother was in a tent behind the stage, pregnant with her baby Memphis. Then, out of nowhere, a 64-year-old man called Stephen Paddock began spraying shots from a hotel window, killing 58 people and injured 400 more.</p><p>It was a terrible situation, and reflecting back on that sad day and her then-unborn kid, Brittney tells PEOPLE,</p><p>“I still think about it every day, and it still makes me shake.” I waited so long to have this child, and now I won’t get to meet him.”</p><p>All is well that ends well; Navy’s parents both survived and have since welcomed both her brother and her into the world.</p><h2><span id=Navy_Rome_Williams8217_parents_met_in_a_bar_and_their_encounter_was_fraught_with_controversy>Navy Rome Williams’ parents met in a bar, and their encounter was fraught with controversy.</span></h2><p>Navy Rome’s parents met in a bar in September 2012.

However, his behavior was observed by the paparazzi, and rumors began to circulate that the singer was having an affair with Kerr while still married to his first wife, Jessica.</p><p>A month later, the country artist apologized to acting poorly and was ashamed of his actions. On September 30, 2012, he apologized to his fans on Facebook.</p><p>“I wanted to speak with you directly so you could hear the truth from me rather than reading about my personal life on gossip websites.”<br>The truth is that I made a mistake. I drank too much, let the party get out of hand, and behaved improperly in a pub. I departed on my own, took the bus to our next gig, and that was the end of the story.”</p><h2><span id=When_Navy8217s_father_met_her_mother_he_was_still_married>When Navy’s father met her mother, he was still married.</span></h2><p>Jason was already married to Jessica Aldean and had two children, Keeley Ann Williams and Kendyl Aldean Williams, who were born in 2003 and 2007, respectively, when he met Rome’s mother. On April 26, 2013, Aldean filed for divorce from his then-wife, alleging irreconcilable differences, and the family of four was having a great time.</p><p>Following the divorce, the singer’s ex-wife married Jake Marlin, an electric lineman.
